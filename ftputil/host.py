    # Implementation notes:
    #
    # Upon every request of a file (`FTPFile` object) a new FTP session is
    # created (or reused from a cache), leading to a child session of the
    # `FTPHost` object from which the file is requested.
    #
    # This is needed because opening an `FTPFile` will make the local session
    # object wait for the completion of the transfer. In fact, code like this
    # would block indefinitely, if the `RETR` request would be made on the
    # `_session` of the object host:
    #
    #   host = FTPHost(ftp_server, user, password)
    #   f = host.open("index.html")
    #   host.getcwd()   # would block!
    #
    # On the other hand, the initially constructed host object will store
    # references to already established `FTPFile` objects and reuse an
    # associated connection if its associated `FTPFile` has been closed.
