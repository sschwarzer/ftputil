ftputil 4.0.0 is now available from
https://ftputil.sschwarzer.net/download .


Changes since the last stable release 3.4
-----------------------------------------

Backward-incompatible changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This ftputil version isn't fully backward-compatible with the previous
version. The backward-incompatible changes are:

- Python 2 is no longer supported.

- The minimum supported Python 3 version is 3.6.

- By default, time stamps in directory listings coming from the server
  are now assumed to be in UTC. Previously, listings were assumed to
  use the local time of the client. [1]

  Correspondingly, the definition of "time shift" has changed. The
  time shift is now defined as the time zone used in server listings
  (say, UTC+02:00) and UTC, in other words, the time shift now is the
  time zone offset applied in the server listings. In earlier ftputil
  versions, the time shift was defined as "time used in server
  listings" minus "local client time."

- The flag `use_list_a_option` of `FTPHost` instances is now set to
  `False` by default. This option was intended to make life easier for
  users, but turned out to be problematic [2].

- As in `os.makedirs`, `FTPHost.makedirs` now supports the `exist_ok`
  flag and uses the default of `False`. You can get the behavior of
  ftputil 3.x by passing `exist_ok=True`. [3]

If you need to use Python versions before 3.6, please use the previous
stable ftputil version 3.4.


Other changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Functions and methods which used to accept only `str` or `bytes`
  paths now _also_ accept `PathLike` objects [4, 5].

- Clear the stat cache when setting a new time shift value. [6]

- ftputil now officially follows semantic versioning (SemVer) [7].
  Actually ftputil has been following semantic versioning since a long
  time (probably since version 2.0 in 2004), but it was never
  explicitly guaranteed and new major versions were named x.0 instead
  of x.0.0 and new minor versions x.y instead of x.y.0.

- Internal changes: The tests were moved to pytest. The old mocking
  approach was replaced by a "scripted session" approach.


What is ftputil?
----------------

ftputil is a high-level FTP client library for the Python programming
language. ftputil implements a virtual file system for accessing FTP
servers, that is, it can generate file-like objects for remote files.
The library supports many functions similar to those in the `os`,
`os.path` and `shutil` modules. ftputil has convenience functions for
conditional uploads and downloads, and handles FTP clients and servers
in different timezones.

Changes since version 3.3.1
---------------------------

- Several bugs were fixed [1-5].

- Added deprecation warnings for backward incompatibilities in the
  upcoming ftputil 4.0.0.


Important note
--------------

The next version of ftputil will be 4.0.0 (apart from small fixes in
possible 3.4.x versions).

ftputil 4.0.0 will make some backward-incompatible changes:

- Support for Python 2 will be removed. There are several reasons for
  this, which are explained in [6].

- The flag `use_list_a_option` will be set to `False` by default. This
  option was intended to make life easier for users, but turned out to
  be problematic (see [7]).

ftputil 3.3.1 is now available from
http://ftputil.sschwarzer.net/download .

Changes since version 3.3
-------------------------

- Fixed a bug where a 226 reply after a remote file close would only
  show up later when doing a `pwd` call on the session. [1] This
  resulted in an `ftplib.error_reply` exception when opening a remote
  file.

Note that ftputil 3.0 broke backward compatibility with ftputil 2.8

ftputil 3.3 is now available from
http://ftputil.sschwarzer.net/download .

Changes since version 3.2
-------------------------

- Added `rest` argument to `FTPHost.open` for recovery after
  interrupted transfers [1].

- Fixed handling of non-ASCII directory and file names under
  Python 2 [2]. Under Python 3, the directory and file names could
  already contain any characters from the ISO 5589-1 (latin-1)
  character set. Under Python 2, non-ASCII characters (even out
  of the latin-1 character set) resulted in a `UnicodeEncodeError`.
  Now Python 2 behaves like Python 3, supporting all latin-1
  characters.

  Note that for interoperability between servers and clients it's
  still usually safest to use only ASCII characters for directory and
  file names.

- Changed `FTPHost.makedirs` for better handling of "virtual
  directories" [3, 4]. Thanks to Roger Demetrescu for the
  implementation.

- Small improvements [5, 6, 7]

Upgrading is recommended.

ftputil 3.2 is now available from
http://ftputil.sschwarzer.net/download .

Changes since version 3.1
-------------------------

- For some platforms (notably Windows) modification datetimes before
  the epoch would cause an `OverflowError` [1]. Other platforms could
  return negative values. Since the Python documentation for the
  `time` module [2] points out that values before the epoch might
  cause problems, ftputil now sets the float value for such datetimes
  to 0.0.

  In theory, this might cause backward compatibility problems, but
  it's very unlikely since pre-epoch timestamps in directory listings
  should be very rare.

- On some platforms, the `time.mktime` implementation could behave
  strange and accept invalid date/time values. For example, a day
  value of 32 would be accepted and implicitly cause a "wrap" to the
  next month. Such invalid values now result in a `ParserError`.

- Make error handling more robust where the underlying FTP session
  factory (for example, `ftplib.FTP`) uses byte strings for exception
  messages. [3]

- Improved error handling for directory listings. As just one example,
  previously a non-integer value for a day would unintentionally cause
  a `ValueError`. Now this causes a `ParserError`.

- Extracted socket file adapter module [4] so that it can be used
  by other projects.

ftputil 3.1 is now available from
http://ftputil.sschwarzer.net/download .

Changes since version 3.0
-------------------------

- Added support for `followlinks` parameter in `FTPHost.walk`. [1]

- Trying to pickle `FTPHost` and `FTPFile` objects now raises explicit
  `TypeError`s to make clear that not being able to pickle these
  objects is intentional. [2]

- Improved exception messages for socket errors [3].

- Fixed handling of server error messages with non-ASCII characters
  when running under Python 2.x. [4]

- Added a generic "session factory factory" to make creation of
  session factories easier for common use cases (encrypted
  connections, non-default port, active/passive mode, FTP session
  debug level and combination of these). [5] This includes a
  workaround for `M2Crypto.ftpslib.FTP_TLS`; this class won't be
  usable with ftputil 3.0 and up with just the session factory recipe
  described in the documentation. [6]

- Don't assume time zone differences to always be full hours, but
  rather 15-minute units. [7] For example, according to [8], Nepal's
  time zone is UTC+05:45.

- Improved documentation on timeout handling. This includes
  information on internal creation of additional FTP connections (for
  remote files, including uploads and downloads). This may help
  understand better why the `keep_alive` method is limited.

ftputil 3.0 is now available from

Changes since version 2.8
-------------------------

Note: This version of ftputil is _not_ backward-compatible
with earlier versions.See the links below for information
on adapting existing client code.

- This version adds Python 3 compatibility! :-)

  The same source is used for Python 2.x and Python 3.x.

  I had to change the API to find a good compromise for
  both Python versions.

- ftputil now requires at least Python 2.6.

- Remote file-like objects use the same semantics as Python's
  `io` module. (This is the same as for the built-in `open`
  function in Python 3.)

- `ftputil.ftp_error` was renamed to `ftputil.error`.

- For custom parsers, import `ftputil.parser` instead of
  `ftputil.stat`.

Changes since version 2.7.1
---------------------------

- After some discussion [1] I decided to remove the auto-probing
  before using the `-a` option for `LIST` [2] to find "hidden" files
  and directories. The option is used by default now, without probing
  for exceptions. If this new approach causes problems, you can use

    ftp_host = ftputil.FTPHost(...)
    ftp_host.use_list_a_option = False

- Several bugs were fixed. [3]

- The mailing lists have moved to

    ftputil@lists.sschwarzer.net
    ftputil-tickets@lists.sschwarzer.net

  The ftputil list [4] requires a subscription before you can post.
  The ftputil-tickets list [5] is read-only anyway.

ftputil 2.7 is now available from
http://ftputil.sschwarzer.net/download .

Changes since version 2.6
-------------------------

- ftputil now explicitly tries to get hidden directory and file
  names (names starting with a dot) from the FTP server. [1]

  Before, ftputil used a `LIST` command to get directory listings, now
  it uses `LIST -a` if the server doesn't explicitly reject its usage
  upon login. Note that the server is free to ignore the `-a` option,
  so "hidden" directories and files may still not be visible. Please
  see [2] for details.

  If you have code that _relies_ on "hidden" directory or file names
  _not_ being visible, please update the code as necessary. If that's
  presumably not possible, please send feedback to the mailing list [3]
  or in private mail [4].

- A bug in the experimental synchronization code was fixed [5]. Thanks
  to Zhuo Qiang for his help. :-)

- The stat caching has been improved. There's now an "auto-grow"
  feature for `FTPHost.listdir` which in turn applies to
  `FTPHost.walk`. Moreover, there were several performance
  optimizations.

ftputil 2.5 is now available from
http://ftputil.sschwarzer.net/download .

Changes since version 2.4.2
---------------------------

- As announced over a year ago [1], the `xreadlines` method for
  FTP file objects has been removed, and exceptions can no longer be
  accessed via the `ftputil` namespace. Only use `ftp_error` to access
  the exceptions.

  The distribution contains a small tool `find_deprecated_code.py` to
  scan a directory tree for the deprecated uses. Invoke the program
  with the `--help` option to see a description.

- Upload and download methods now accept a `callback` argument to do
  things during a transfer. Modification time comparisons in
  `upload_if_newer` and `download_if_newer` now consider the timestamp
  precision of the remote file which may lead to some unnecessary
  transfers. These can be avoided by waiting at least a minute between
  calls of `upload_if_newer` (or `download_if_newer`) for the same
  file. See the documentation for details [2].

- The `FTPHost` class got a `keep_alive` method. It should be used
  carefully though, not routinely. Please read the description [3] in
  the documentation.

- Several bugs were fixed [4-7].

- The source code was restructured. The tests are now in a `test`
  subdirectory and are no longer part of the release archive. You can
  still get them via the source repository. Licensing matters have
  been moved to a common `LICENSE` file.

ftputil 2.4.2 is now available from
http://ftputil.sschwarzer.net/download .

Changes since version 2.4.1
---------------------------

- Some FTP servers seem to have problems using *any* directory
  argument which contains slashes. The new default for FTP commands
  now is to change into the directory before actually invoking the
  command on a relative path (report and fix suggestion by Nicola
  Murino).

- Calling the method ``FTPHost.stat_cache.resize`` with an argument 0
  caused an exception. This has been fixed; a zero cache size now
  of course doesn't cache anything but doesn't lead to a traceback
  either.

- The installation script ``setup.py`` didn't work with the ``--home``
  option because it still tried to install the documentation in a
  system directory (report by Albrecht Mühlenschulte).

  As a side effect, when using the *global* installation, the
  documentation is no longer installed in the ftputil package
  directory but in a subdirectory ``doc`` of a directory determined by
  Distutils. For example, on my system (Ubuntu 9.04) the documentation
  files are put into ``/usr/local/doc``.

Upgrading is recommended.

Changes since version 2.4
-------------------------

Several bugs were fixed:

- On Windows, some accesses to the stat cache caused it to become
  inconsistent, which could also trigger exceptions (report and patch
  by Peter Stirling).

- In ftputil 2.4, the use of ``super`` in the exception base class
  caused ftputil to fail on Python <2.5 (reported by Nicola Murino).
  ftputil is supposed to run with Python 2.3+.

- The conversion of 12-hour clock times to 24-hour clock in the MS
  format parser was wrong for 12 AM and 12 PM.

Upgrading is strongly recommended.

ftputil 2.4 is now available from
http://ftputil.sschwarzer.net/download .

Changes since version 2.3
-------------------------

The ``FTPHost`` class got a new method ``chmod``, similar to
``os.chmod``, to act on remote files. Thanks go to Tom Parker for
the review.

There's a new exception ``CommandNotImplementedError``, derived from
``PermanentError``, to denote commands not implemented by the FTP
server or disabled by its administrator.

Using the ``xreadlines`` method of FTP file objects causes a warning
through Python's warnings framework.

Upgrading is recommended.

Incompatibility notice
----------------------

The ``xreadlines`` method will be removed in ftputil *2.5* as well as
the direct access of exception classes via the ftputil module (e. g.
``ftputil.PermanentError``). However, the deprecated access causes no
warning because that would be rather difficult to implement.

The distribution contains a small tool find_deprecated_code.py to scan
a directory tree for the deprecated uses. Invoke the program with the

ftputil 2.3 is now available from
http://ftputil.sschwarzer.net/download .

Changes since version 2.2.4
---------------------------

ftputil has got support for the ``with`` statement which was introduced
by Python 2.5. You can now construct host and remote file objects in
``with`` statements and have them closed automatically (contributed
by Roger Demetrescu). See the documentation for examples.

What is ftputil?
----------------

ftputil is a high-level FTP client library for the Python programming
language. ftputil implements a virtual file system for accessing FTP
servers, that is, it can generate file-like objects for remote files.
The library supports many functions similar to those in the os,
os.path and shutil modules. ftputil has convenience functions for
conditional uploads and downloads, and handles FTP clients and servers
in different timezones.

ftputil 2.2 is now available from
http://ftputil.sschwarzer.net/download .

Changes since version 2.1
-------------------------

- Results of stat calls (also indirect calls, i. e. listdir,
  isdir/isfile/islink, exists, getmtime etc.) are now cached and
  reused. This results in remarkable speedups for many use cases.
  Thanks to Evan Prodromou for his permission to add his lrucache
  module under ftputil's license.

- The current directory is also locally cached, resulting in further
  speedups.

- It's now possible to write and plug in custom parsers for directory
  formats which ftputil doesn't support natively.

- File-like objects generated via ``FTPHost.file`` now support the
  iterator protocol (for line in some_file: ...).

- The documentation has been updated accordingly. Read it under
  http://ftputil.sschwarzer.net/trac/wiki/Documentation .

Possible incompatibilities:

- This release requires at least Python 2.3. (Previous releases
  worked with Python versions from 2.1 up.)

- The method ``FTPHost.set_directory_format`` has been removed,
  since the directory format (Unix or MS) is set automatically. (The
  new method ``set_parser`` is a different animal since it takes
  a parser object to parse "foreign" formats, not a string.)

The second beta version of ftputil 2.2 is available. You can download
it from http://ftputil.sschwarzer.net/download .

With respect to the first beta release, it's now possible to write
and plug in custom parsers for FTP directory formats that ftputil
doesn't know natively. The documentation has been updated accordingly.

The documentation for this release is online at
http://ftputil.sschwarzer.net/trac/wiki/Documentation#Documentationforftputil2.2b2 ,
so you can read about the extensions in more detail.

Please download and test the release. Do you miss something which
should be in this release? Are there any bugs?

----------------------------------------------------------------------
The first beta version of ftputil 2.2 is available. You can download
it from http://ftputil.sschwarzer.net/download .

With respect to the previous alpha release, the cache now uses the
lrucache module by Evan Prodromou which is bundled with the ftputil
distribution. (Evan also gave his permission to include the module
under ftputil's modified BSD license instead of the Academic License.)
The documentation for the cache and its control have been added to
ftputil.txt / ftputil.html .

File objects generated with FTPHost.file now support the iterator
protocol (for line in some_file: ...).

Please download and test the release. Do you miss something which
should be in this release? Are there any bugs?

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Welcome to the first alpha release of ftputil 2.2, ftputil 2.2a1.
Please download it from http://ftputil.sschwarzer.net/download .

This version adds caching of stat results to ftputil. This also
affects indirect calls via FTPHost.path, e. g. methods isfile,
exists, getmtime, getsize. The test script at
http://ftputil.sschwarzer.net/trac/browser/tags/release2_2a1/sandbox/list_dir_test.py
runs about 20 times as fast as before adding caching! :-)

As the "alpha" part implies, this release is not production-ready,
it's even kind of experimental: The caching works but there's no
cache entry expiration yet. (I plan to implement an LRU expiration
strategy or something similar.) Apart from that, the release is
tested as any production release. I suggest using the --prefix
option for installing alpha releases.

That said, it would be helpful if you tested this release and
report your findings. When testing the code, please make sure
that your code uses the ftputil version you intend (alpha vs.
production version), e. g. by setting the PYTHONPATH environment
variable. I'm very interested in the speedups - and any problems
you encounter.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
ftputil 2.1.1 is now available from
http://ftputil.sschwarzer.net/download .

This release fixes a bug which happened when a client opened
a large file on the server as a file-like object and read
only a part of it. For details, see
http://ftputil.sschwarzer.net/trac/ticket/17 .

Stefan

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since version 2.0
-------------------------

- Added new methods to the FTPHost class, namely makedirs, walk,
  rmtree.

- The FTP server directory format ("Unix" vs. "Windows") is now set
  automatically (thanks to Andrew Ittner for testing it).

- Border cases like inaccessible login directories and whitespace in
  directory names, are now handled more gracefully (based on input
  from Valeriy Pogrebitskiy, Tommy Sundström and H. Y. Chu).

- The documentation was updated.

- A Russian translation of the documentation (currently slightly
  behind) was contributed by Anton Stepanov. It's also on the website
  at http://ftputil.sschwarzer.net/trac/wiki/RussianDocumentation .

- New website, http://ftputil.sschwarzer.net/ with wiki, issue tracker
  and Subversion repository (thanks to Trac!)

  Please enter not only bugs but also enhancement request into
  the issue tracker!

Possible incompatibilities:

- The exception hierarchy was changed slightly, which might break
  client code. See http://ftputil.sschwarzer.net/trac/changeset/489
  for the change details and the possibly necessary code changes.

- FTPHost.rmdir no longer removes non-empty directories. Use the new
  method FTPHost.rmtree for this.

This release fixes (for most cases) some problems when logging into an
FTP server with an inaccessible login directory, i. e. `getcwd()`
returns "/some/login/dir" but `chdir("/some/login/dir")` fails.

Thanks go to Valeriy Pogrebitskiy for investigating and reporting
these problems.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Here's ftputil 2.0 !

ftputil is a high-level alternative to Python's ftplib module. With
ftputil, you can access directories and files on remote FTP servers
almost as if they were in your local file system. This includes using
file-like objects representing remote files.

For future releases see
http://www.sschwarzer.net/python/python_software.html
or subscribe to the mailing list at
http://codespeak.net/mailman/listinfo/ftputil

What's new?
-----------

From version 1.1 to 2.0, the following has changed:

- ftputil has been re-organized and is now a Python package (the
  import statement is still the same)

- installation via Python distutils

- stat, upload_if_newer, download_if_newer etc. work correctly if the
  server is in another time zone than the client running ftputil (with
  help from Andrew Ittner); see section "Time zone correction" in the
  documentation

- it's possible to set the directory listing format "manually" (though
  in most cases it's recognized automatically); see section "Stat'ing
  files and directories"

- added a workaround regarding whitespace in directory names (thanks
  to Tommy Sundström and H. Y. Chu)

- extended documentation and converted it to HTML format (now
  generated from reStructured Text)

- several bugfixes

- there's now a mailing list at http://codespeak.net/mailman/listinfo/ftputil
  (thanks to Holger Krekel)

Documentation

ftputil 1.1 is released. You can find it at
http://www.ndh.net/home/sschwarzer/python/python_software.html .

ftputil provides a higher-level interface for FTP sessions than the
ftplib module. FTP servers can be accessed via an interface similar to
os and os.path. Remote files are accessible as file-like objects.

New since version 1.0:

- ftputil now runs under Python 2.1+ (not only 2.2+).
- documentation
- conditional upload/download (depending on local and remote file
  timestamps)
- FTPHost.stat follows links
- a session factory other than the default, ftplib.FTP, can be given
  in the FTPHost constructor; this allows to use classes derived from
  ftplib.FTP (like ftpslib.FTP_TLS from the M2Crypto package)
- several bugfixes (mostly regarding byte count in text mode
  transfers)
- unit test

Stefan
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello Pythoneers :)

I would like to announce ftputil.py, a module which provides a
more friendly interface for FTP sessions than the ftplib module.

The FTPHost objects generated from it allow many operations similar
to those of os and os.path. Examples:

  # download some files from the login directory
  import ftputil
  host = ftputil.FTPHost('ftp.domain.com', 'user', 'secret')
  names = host.listdir(host.curdir)
  for name in names:
      if host.path.isreg(name):
          host.download(name, name, 'b')  # remote, local, binary mode

  # make a new directory and copy a remote file into it
  host.mkdir('newdir')
  source = host.file('index.html', 'r')  # file-like object
  target = host.file('newdir/index.html', 'w')  # file-like object
  host.copyfileobj(source, target)  # mimics shutil.copyfileobj
  source.close()
  target.close()

Even host.path.walk works. :-) But slow. ;-)

ftputil.py can be downloaded from
http://www.ndh.net/home/sschwarzer/download/ftputil.py

I would like to get your suggestions and comments. :-)

Stefan
