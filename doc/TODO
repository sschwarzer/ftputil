Planned:

- Python 3 support (see
  ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc2640.txt for some notes on
  internationalization)

- clean up the code by using decorators

- add `ftp_session` module containing session classes (e. g. for
  passive mode connections)


Ideas for future development:

- see ticket system

- WebDAV support?
