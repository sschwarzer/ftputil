What's new in ftputil 3.0?
==========================

* Support for Python 3

* *Dropped* support for Python 2.4 and 2.5

* Unicode strings are preferred

* *Paths* (*not* contents) use latin-1 encoding when sent/received
  over socket (compatibility with ftplib in Python 3)

* New file semantics (like ``io`` module)

* `FTPHost.file` is gone; it's always `FTPHost.open`
  (maybe defer this to 3.1?)

* Some module names changed
  ftp_error -> error
  ftp_stat -> stat
  ftp_sync -> sync


Not yet implemented but considered
----------------------------------

* Uploads and downloads are always binary
